# Evolutionary Algorithms Experiments

This repository contains implementations of various evolutionary algorithms including:

- Differential Evolution (DE)
- Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)
- Co-evolutionary Algorithm
- Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA)
- Distributed Genetic Algorithm (DGA)

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Experiments

To run an experiment with one of the evolutionary algorithms, execute one of the following files:

- `DE.py`
- `cma_es.py`
- `co_evolution.py`
- `SGA.py`
- `DGA.py`

Each script allows customization of parameters such as:

- Number of runs
- Optimization scenario
- Algorithm-specific settings

Modify the corresponding file to set these parameters before execution.

## Results

Results from the experiments are automatically stored in the `results/` directory.

Feel free to explore and analyze the outcomes using your preferred tools or scripts.
